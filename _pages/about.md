I am a PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), affiliated with the [Research Program in Political Economy](https://rppe.princeton.edu/). During the 2024-2025 academic year, I was a research fellow at the [Yale Institute for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/), collaborating with [Adam Meirowitz](https://isps.yale.edu/team/adam-meirowitz) and [Alan Gerber](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/alan-gerber). I graduated from Yale in 2024, where I majored in Mathematics and obtained a second degree in Economics. My senior thesis was advised by [Dirk Bergemann](https://economics.yale.edu/people/dirk-bergemann).

I study theoretical political economy and other areas of applied economic theory, where most of my research examines the relationship between political competition and market competition. My work applies tools from industrial organization, market design, and mechanism design to understand how strategic interactions between voters, candidates, private interests and firms jointly shape policy and market outcomes.

In addition, I previosuly have worked in the Research and Statistics Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I worked on Bayesian estimation of macroeconomic models and econometric theory in the [Applied Macroeconomics & Econometrics Center (AMEC)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/amec).

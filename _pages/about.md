I am a PhD student at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), affiliated with the [Research Program in Political Economy](https://rppe.princeton.edu/). During the 2024-2025 academic year, I was a research fellow at the [Yale Institute for Social and Policy Studies](https://isps.yale.edu/), collaborating with [Adam Meirowitz](https://isps.yale.edu/team/adam-meirowitz) and [Alan Gerber](https://politicalscience.yale.edu/people/alan-gerber). I graduated from Yale in 2024, where I majored in Mathematics and obtained a second degree in Economics. My senior thesis was advised by [Dirk Bergemann](https://economics.yale.edu/people/dirk-bergemann).

I am broadly interested in the intersection of political economy and economic theory, where my research focuses on the application of game theory to the study of elections and collective decision-making. I currently study polarization in models of elections with uncertainty, social learning in voting games, and mechanism-design approaches to understanding political accountability. 

In addition, I previosuly have worked in the Research and Statistics Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I worked on Bayesian estimation of macroeconomic models and econometric theory in the [Applied Macroeconomics & Econometrics Center (AMEC)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/amec).

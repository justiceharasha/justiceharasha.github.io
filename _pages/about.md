Hello! I am an undergraduate at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), pursuing a B.A. in Mathematics, along with a second degree in Economics. I am broadly interested in economic theory, particularly in the application of mechanism design to settings without monetary transfers and game theoretic approaches to problems in political economy. I am currently advised by [Dirk Bergemann](https://economics.yale.edu/people/dirk-bergemann) and [Adam Meirowitz](https://isps.yale.edu/team/adam-meirowitz).

In addition to my research interests in microeconomic theory and mechanism design, I have worked in the Research and Statistics Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I worked on Bayesian estimation of macroeconomic models and econometric theory in the [Applied Macroeconomics & Econometrics Center (AMEC)](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/amec).

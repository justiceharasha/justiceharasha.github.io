## Private Posterior Implementation in Collective Decision Problems

<summary>Abstract</summary>

Posterior implementation is a sparsely studied solution concept for mechanism design when there are interdependent agent types. In posterior equilibrium, it is required that each agent's strategy is optimal with respect to the strategies played by their fellow agents for each possible message profile. There are two main considerations of posterior implementation in the current literature. First, Green and Laffont (1987) offer a geometric characterization of posterior implementable social choice functions in two agent, binary collective decision problems. Then, Niemeyer (2022) generalizes this analysis by considering binary collective decision problems with any number $n$ of finitely many agents, with the main insight being that posterior implementable social choice functions are posterior implementable by score voting mechanisms. In both cases, it is assumed that all messages sent by agents are publicly observable. In this paper, we examine cases where only some aspects of agent messages are observable. Namely, we consider a case where agents submit their messages to a a central agent, or collector, who then uses these reports to make a public choice. Agents, therefore, form posterior beliefs regarding the types of their fellow agents based on this public choice, not on the granular message reports of their fellow agents. This, in turn, creates coarser agent posterior beliefs. We thus define an amended notion of posterior implementation, which we denote \textit{private posterior implementation}, and for this, obtain a complete characterization of the set of privately posterior implementable decision rules in $n$-person binary collective decision problems. We also consider non-binary collective decision problems, where the public choice is a parameter, such as a price vector, and discuss the challenges that arise in such settings.

## Strategy-Proofness in Elections with Multidimensional Signals

<summary>Abstract</summary>

From Moulin's classic 1980 result, we know that, under a single-peaked domain, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem can be sufficiently relaxed such that voters truthfully report their best preferred alternative when the central authority elects the median-reported `peak.' This well-studied result provides an initial framing for this paper. We consider a two period election setting, where a policy is fixed in the first period. Agents report their ideal point and a \textit{strength of preference} parameter, which denotes how sharply their utility decreases in movement to either direction of their ideal point. From this construction, we employ a mechanism design setting without transfers to consider the set of social choice functions that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium when agents are reporting this additional parameter. Then, after establishing the set of implementable social choice functions in a setting that does not allow transfers, we consider the same two period election setting where agents report an ideal point and strength of preference parameter, now allowing for monetary transfers and proceeding to characterize the set of social choice functions that are implementable in dominant strategies when transfers are allowed. We conclude with a brief discussion of application, namely considering how our results prove that it is in the best interest of party leaders and policymakers to consider the strength of voter preferences in movements away from ideal points and seek to give those with higher \textit{strength of preference} parameters stronger sways over party directions and policy decision-making.
